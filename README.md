I do love building tools that make learning easier.


🔹 𝙒𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙞𝙩 𝙙𝙤𝙚𝙨
✅ Converts natural language topics
✅ Converts handwritten reaction images
➡️ Into clean, structured chemical mechanism visuals

Understanding reaction mechanisms is hard for many students.
There is no cost-effective tool that solves this problem clearly.
This tool helps in learning, teaching, and visualizing chemistry clearly.

The core idea came from my cousin brother, 𝗡𝗮𝘆𝗮𝗻 𝗞𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗿 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗹.

Simple UI, clear mechanisms, student-friendly approach.
Still improving it, still learning — but proud of this step 💙
